    <h1>About Our Service</h1>
    <hr />
    <p class="about-text">
      We offer a transportation service that accepts square payments
      and offer customers to select their driver. By selecting a driver
      , customers also can see the type of car they will be picked up in,
      how much room is available, and previous customer ratings. We do 
      a background check and verify our drivers to ensure that they are 
      always ready to serve our customers.
    </p>
    <p class="about-text">
      When accepting a ride, booking, or cancelling, we ask that you do 
      so within a time frame of 1 hour. That is to ensure that the driver 
      has been informed and opens a window for another customer. No call 
      no show fees are $35, and that is because if you schedule the driver 
      and decide not to be reachable or show up, then you will cover the 
      gas it took to come to the location.
